# My first readme through the ALX Software Engineering Certification Programme

I am a student now. It's time to focus and hone my ability to do hard things

This program requires 70+ hours from it's participants, those hours come from
reading and having to figure thiings out.

It's not easy but the triumphant feeling you get when you succeed is unmatched.
